## 📊 Types of Cases in Algorithm Analysis

* **Worst Case** → `O(n)`
* **Best Case** → `O(1)`
* **Average Case** → `O((n + 1) / 2)`

## ⏳ Time & Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity** → The time required by an algorithm to solve the given problem.
* **Space Complexity** → The amount of memory required by an algorithm to execute the program.

## 🧮 Asymptotic Notations

Asymptotic notation describes the **limiting behavior of functions** in the context of analyzing algorithm efficiency.

There are three main notations:

1. **Big-O (`O`)** → **Upper Bound** (worst-case performance)
2. **Big-Omega (`Ω`)** → **Lower Bound** (best-case performance)
3. **Theta (`Θ`)** → **Tight Bound** (average/expected performance)

📌 Relationship:

$$
\Omega(f(n)) \; \leq \; \Theta(f(n)) \; \leq \; O(f(n))
$$
